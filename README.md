List of Ideas
=========
* Skywars themed
* Park themed
 * Grass, benches, trees, flowers, parky things.
* Fun hub.
 * Leave looks behind and focus on making it fun. (this is a bad idea but I'm putting it here anyways)
* Modern themed
* Mini Maps
 * Have some iconic nebula maps under the floor in a mini version. (this might work if done correctly)
* Dark themed - Lava, Coal Blocks, and Dragons or Warrior statues C: Voxel too op plz nerf - Adrian

Feel free to add ideas here, but if you want to remove an idea please discuss it in the skype chat or create an issue.

Note

Rage INC may not follow through with creating an Avicus Hub, but we're brain storming.
